          # role-playing game and generates a very terse but colorful outline.
          # An NPC is any character mentioned in the description and should be bolded.
          # The DM is the person who runs the game and knows all the secret information about locations and NPCs.

          # Format the output as MarkDown
          # The top level of the outline should be a level 1 header with the name of the location, for example "# K10. Dining Hall".
          # The second level of the outline should be plain text without bullet points, for example "Dusty Crates".
          # The third level and below should be a regular bullet point list describing the second level node, for example "- rotten and worthless food".

          # Areas often have a number or a letter and a number, for example "B2. Dank Cellar" or "K10. Dining Hall". Usually, the letters correspond to a floor or level or large outdoor area, and the numbers are sequential and correspond to a location within the letter's area.

          # If there is secret information that is not directly discoverable by the PCs, it should be contained in a DM note node, marked with "Note: " at the beginning of the bullet point.


What follows is an area description from a tabletop role playing game scenario.

Please provide a concise list of the hierarchically organized elements in this area, with top-level items representing the most prominent features and child nodes for details revealed through exploration of or interaction with the room and its elements.  

A features that should be considered prominent include the key architectural aspects of the area, prominent furniture or decorations, interactive elements such as a set of levers or a trap, immediate threats such as a bear or a fire, immediate obstacles such as a collapsed passage, or immediate opportunities such as a person to talk to.  Features should be combined into one top-level element if one contains the other such as a bear in an alcove.

# general environmental details should be included in plain text just below the area name header. These should include
# - the size of the area if mentioned
# - smells, ambient sounds, warmth, cold, humidity
# - light, shadow, motes in the air

Here is an example of a location description:
---
2.STORAGE ROOM
This room contains rotting bales of what might be cloth, and dusty crates. 
The room smells like it has been closed off for a long time.
The room is an old storage room that has long been abandoned.
The food once in the crates, and the clothing once in the bales, is now rotted and worthless. 
Otherwise, the room is empty.
---
And here is the outline that you should generate:
---
# 2. Storage Room

The smell of being closed off for a long time
Rotting bales of what might be cloth
Dusty crates

- rotted and worthless food

Note: The room is an old storage room that has long been abandoned
---

When there is hidden but discoverable information, such as a secret door or an event that is triggered by an action, the outline should include a node that describes the action needed to reveal the hidden information, marked with a triangle ▲.
The child nodes of this node should describe the hidden information. Here is an example and its outline:

---
24. Covered Hole: The orcs have concealed a large hole in the floor of this chamber with thin pieces of shale laid across a rope net. Anyone stumbling into the trap falls 25' into the otyugh pit (see Lower Gorge, area 4). 
Victims suffer only d6 points of damage as their fall is somewhat cushioned by thick muck.
---
# 24. Covered Hole

Thin pieces of shale cover floor

- ▲ Look under shale
    - Shale conceals a rope net suspended over a pit
    - Note: trap laid by orcs
- ▲ Step on shale
    - Fall 25' into the otyugh pit (Lower Gorge, area 4)
    - d6 points of damage, fall is cushioned by thick muck
---

If the location has an important feature such as a monster, NPC, or treasure, then its name should be bolded. Here is an example and its outline:

---
4. GUARD ROOM: Here are 3 very large kobold guards with chain mail and bows to fire down the passage at attackers (AC 5, HD 1+ 1, hp 5 each, #AT I, D 1-6,MV (40'), Save NM, ML 6). The guards will hide behind the corner for cover, so all missiles fired at them will be at -2 “to hit”. Each carries a hand axe in his belt and a purse with 2d6 gold pieces.
