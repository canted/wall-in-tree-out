K19. Grand Landing
Massive stairs rise to a landing 20 feet wide by 40 feet long.
Stone arches support a ceiling covered with frescos, 20 feet
overhead. The frescos faded lines depict the stone mountain
atop which Ravenloft stands, being taken by armored forces on
horseback. The faces of the characters in the fresco are scratched
beyond recognition. Dust floats in the air here, making it
difficult to see details. There is a staircase on each side of the
20-foot-wide south wall. There are two alcoves between the
staircases. Light filtering through the dust shows two suits of
armor covered with dark stains, one standing in each alcove.
Each suit of armor holds a mace designed like a curved dragon
head. Engraved words on the arches above the alcoves are
scratched out.
Both staircases lead to K25. The massive stairs lead down to K8.
Anyone crossing in front of the alcoves activates the suits of armor.
The suits of armor are rigged to a mechanical device activated
by pressure plates in front of the alcoves. There is a 60% chance that
any weight over 400 gp (40 pounds) activates the trap. When
activated, one of the suits springs forward, flailing its arms and
mace. It hits and does 1-4 points of damage if it rolls 16+ on 1d20.
After leaping out it retracts, only to leap again if weight is still on
the plate. The device is purely mechanical and acts very much like
a puppet. This little joke is intended to spook more than damage.
